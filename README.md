## 🏢 Business Problem

Organizations involved in **disaster management, public policy, insurance, and environmental research** depend on large analytical reports to make critical decisions. These reports are typically published as **complex PDF documents** that contain a mixture of **long-form text, statistical tables, and visual charts**.

Despite containing valuable insights, these documents present several challenges:

* Information is **locked inside static PDFs**
* Manual reading and analysis are **time-consuming**
* Keyword-based search tools **fail to capture context**
* Traditional AI systems **cannot correctly interpret tables and figures**
* Non-technical users struggle to extract **actionable insights quickly**

As a result, decision-makers face delays, increased operational risk, and inefficient use of historical data—especially during time-sensitive situations such as wildfire response and preparedness planning.

## 💡 Business Solution

This project delivers an **AI-powered Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that transforms complex wildfire reports into an **interactive decision-support assistant**.

The system enables users to ask **natural language questions** and instantly receive **accurate, data-backed answers** grounded in the original report content—including **text, tables, and charts**.

### Key Capabilities

* 🔍 **Semantic Search Across Modalities**
  Retrieves relevant information from text, tables, and visual figures—not just keywords.

* 🧠 **Multimodal Reasoning**
  Understands numerical data, visual trends, and written explanations together for accurate insights.

* 📄 **Source-Grounded Answers**
  Responses are generated using original report data, reducing hallucinations and improving trust.

* ⚡ **Faster Decision-Making**
  Reduces analysis time from hours of manual review to seconds.
